###Project Purpose
I embarked on this project as part of a class challenge to showcase my proficiency in Advanced CSS. It was a personal endeavor to gauge my progress and practical application of the concepts learned.

####Objectives Achieved
Utilized flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables extensively throughout the web application.
Developed and deployed a portfolio to highlight my professional work.
Created a dynamic webpage featuring recent photos, personal information, and dedicated sections covering my background, projects, and contact details.


Implemented smooth navigation that seamlessly scrolls to corresponding sections when users click on navigation links.
Enhanced user experience by ensuring that clicking on the "work" link directs users specifically to the images section of the webpage.


Featured the first image in the applications section prominently, making it larger than subsequent images for visual impact.
Enabled direct access to deployed applications by allowing users to click on project images.
